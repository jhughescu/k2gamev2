	<p>You will see a head bubble appear on your screen when a climber is in need of assistance. Select the bubble to listen to their radio call.</p>

	<p>After the call, you will need to decide how best to assist your climber.</p>

	<p>Solving problems will generally incur additional waiting time or use up your climberâ€™s resources.</p>

	<p>Generally, you will be able to ask fellow climbers in the same section for assistance with a problem, but they can say no to helping you!</p>

	<p>During your climb, you can help other climbers by sharing your resources with them.</p>
